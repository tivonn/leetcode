## description

```
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.
```

## solution

base64的编码、解码

```javascript
/**
 * Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
 *
 * @param {string} longUrl
 * @return {string}
 */
var encode = function (longUrl) {
  return 'http://tinyurl.com/' + new Buffer(longUrl).toString('base64')
}

/**
 * Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
 *
 * @param {string} shortUrl
 * @return {string}
 */
var decode = function (shortUrl) {
  return new Buffer((shortUrl.split('http://tinyurl.com/')[1]), 'base64').toString()
}

/**
 * Your functions will be called as such:
 * decode(encode(url));
 */
```
